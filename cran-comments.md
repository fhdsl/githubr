## Comments:
* This is a new package. Third time submission
* Added documentation in the \dontrun examples. These examples can't be run on CRAN because they require credentials for someone's access to GitHub API.
* Also added two simple tests but these will only be run if there are credentials in the environment. Fixed some bugs about why these are being run anyway in other OS's.
